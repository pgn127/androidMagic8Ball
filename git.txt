Git questions

1.Git handles data different than Subversion and other VCS. Git thinks of data in a way that everytime you commit it will remember what all the files look like at that exact moment and store a reference to that "snapshot"/ Other systems 
look at things like a set of files and changes made to files over time. 
2. What is a branch? When is it the right time to create a branch?
a branch should be created when you are working on another part of the project and making changes that you will later merge with 
other parts of the project
you use branches when you want to try new ideas 
3. If you’ve forgotten to setup a git repository in the IDE, what is the command to create a git repository
and add all created files?
git init will initialize a repository
git add . will add all the files in the current directory
git commit -m "add a message" will commit the change into the repository
4. Sometimes you don’t want to include all files in a repository, how do you avoid this?
you dont write "." but instead drag the specific file after you write add
5. Once you’ve made changes to a file/s, what’s the command to save these into the repository? When is
it recommended that you do this?
you do git commit -m "write a message about the change".  
when you are ready to save these changes you will commit them
